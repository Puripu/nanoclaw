I took gavrielc/nanoclaw and added some functions to it. My programming skills are very limited, so this is all "vibecoded" with claude code and jules.google.

Small functions added:
- Telegram functionality
- Docker based rather than Apple containers
- Heartbeat function
- Renamed it Bob!

So far, it all works, except that I need to refresh the claude oAuth token every day. To be continued.
