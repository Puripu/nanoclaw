## Quick Context

Single Node.js process that connects to WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord, routes messages to agents running in isolated Docker containers. Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Main app: WhatsApp connection, message routing, IPC |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/model-providers/gemini-provider.ts` | Gemini native runner with Playwright/Overseerr |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management (Linux):
```bash
sudo systemctl start nanoclaw
sudo systemctl stop nanoclaw
sudo systemctl restart nanoclaw
sudo journalctl -u nanoclaw -f # View logs
```
