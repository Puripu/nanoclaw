# Heartbeat Configuration

## Purpose
This file tracks tasks, reminders, and monitoring items that should be checked during periodic heartbeat runs.

## How It Works
- Every 30 minutes, I'll check this file and my workspace
- If something needs attention, I'll send you a message
- If everything is OK, I stay silent

## Active Monitors

### Reminders
<!-- Add time-based reminders here -->
- None currently

### Recurring Checks
<!-- Add things to monitor periodically -->
- None currently

### Scheduled Tasks
<!-- Track upcoming tasks or deadlines -->
- None currently

## Notes
- You can add items to any section above
- Use clear language about when/what needs attention
- I'll clean up completed items during heartbeats
