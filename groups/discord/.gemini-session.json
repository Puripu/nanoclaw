Here are the changes:\n\r\n\n\r\nClasses\n\r\n\n\r\nDeath Knight\n\r\nHero Talents\n\r\nDeathbringer\n\r\nFrost\n\r\nExterminate first scythe damage increased by 30%.\nReaper’s Mark damage increased by 25%.\nDeathly Blows now increases the damage of Frost Strike by 15% (was 5%).\nSwift and Painful now grants 8% increased Strength when no enemies are struck by Soul Rupture (was 5%).\n\nRider of the Apocalypse\n\r\nAuto-attack damage of all Horsemen is reduced by 50%.\nHungering Thirst now increases the damage of diseases, Frost Strike, Frostbane, and Death Coil by 5%, and now also affects Necrotic Coil.\nFrost\n\r\nFeast of Souls now increases the damage of Runic Power abilities by 10% when you have 2 or more active Horsemen (was 20%).\n\nUnholy\n\r\nWhitemane’s Epidemic damage increased 150%.\nTrollbane’s Icy Fury damage increased by 100%.\nUndeath damage increased by 50%.\n\nSan’layn\n\r\nUnholy\n\r\nInevitable now increases the damage of diseases by up to 30% (was 20%).\nInfliction of Sorrow now causes Vampiric Strike to extend the duration of plagues by 3 seconds (was 2 seconds).\n\nBlood\n\r\nDeath Strike damage increased by 20%.\nBlood Boil damage increased by 15%.\nHeart Strike damage increased by 20%.\nDeath and Decay damage increased by 25%.\nConsumption damage increased by 30%.\nBone Shield Armor increased by 20%.\nBlood Fortification Stamina increased to 35% (was 30%).\nApex Talent: Dance of Midnight (Rank 1) now has 100% chance to trigger.\n\nFrost\n\r\nObliterate damage increased by 15%.\nFrost Strike damage reduced by 10%.\nFrostbane damage reduced by 10%.\n\nUnholy\n\r\nAll damage increased by 8%.\n\nDemon Hunter\n\r\nHero Talents\n\r\nAldrachi Reaver\n\r\nReaver’s Glaive damage reduced by 10%.\nReaver’s Mark now increases damage taken by 5% per stack (was 6%).\n\nVoid-Scarred\n\r\nDevourer\n\r\nDevelopers’ notes: We’re taking some power out of Void-Scarred’s Metamorphosis window and shifting it to their non-Metamorphosis effects.\nFlamebound has been updated – Hungering Slash critical strike damage bonus increased to 125% (was 50%). This does not affect PvP combat.\nThe damage bonus of Metamorphosis-empowered versions of Voidblade, Hungering Slash, and The Hunt reduced to 20% (was 30%).\nMonster Rising now grants 15% increased Intellect when outside of Metamorphosis (was 8%).\nEnduring Torment now increases the effectiveness of Mastery outside of Metamorphosis by 20% (was 10%).\n\nDevourer\n\r\nReap damage increased by 75%.\nConsume damage increased by 30% and now generates 1 additional Soul Fragment.\nShattered Souls now has a 4% chance to cause a damaging spell to generate a Soul Fragment (was 8%).\nEntropy now grants you a Soul Fragment every 12 seconds while in combat (was 8 seconds).\nWaste Not now causes Void Ray to have a 200% increased chance of generating a Soul Fragment (was 100%).\nFixed an issue causing male Devourer Demon Hunters to sometimes have a female voice during Void Metamorphosis.\n\nDruid\n\r\nHero Talents\n\r\nKeeper of the Grove\n\r\nBalance\n\r\nSpirit of the Thicket now increases Starfall damage by 12% (was 8%).\n\nRestoration\n\r\nPotent Enchantments increases Incarnation’s duration by 6 seconds (was 3 seconds).\n\nClass\n\r\nMatted Fur absorption increased by 100%.\nMatted Fur lasts 15 seconds (was 8 seconds).\nRegrowth direct healing reduced by 15%.\nWild Growth healing increased by 25%.\n\nBalance\n\r\nStarfire now deals 70% of primary target damage to nearby enemies (was 50%).\nStarfall damage increased by 10%.\nStarsurge damage increased by 5%.\nSunseeker Mushroom and Wild Mushroom damage increased by 10%.\nPower of Goldrinn damage increased by 5%.\nDenizen of the Dream damage reduced by 15%.\n\r\nDevelopers’ notes: We’re rolling back some of the previous bonus to Denizen to move that damage into your own abilities instead.\n\nStellar Amplification increases your periodic effect damage on affected targets by 16% (was 20%).\n\nGuardian\n\r\nArmor granted by Ironfur increased by 10%.\nMangle damage increased by 30%.\nLunar Beam damage increased by 30%.\nMoonfire damage increased by 30%.\nRed Moon damage increased by 30%.\nInnate Resolve now increases Frenzied Regeneration’s healing by up to 80% (was 120%).\nFrenzied Regeneration now heals for 32% of maximum health over its duration (was 40%).\nFrenzied Regeneration’s cooldown reduced to 26 seconds (was 36 seconds).\nUrsoc’s Fury now grants an absorb shield for 30% of damage dealt by Thrash and Maul (was 40%).\nMoonless Night increased to 40% (was 20%).\nKilling Blow causes Maul and Raze to deal up to 100% increased damage (was 75%).\n\nRestoration\n\r\nDevelopers’ notes: The goal of these changes is to reduce Restoration Druid’s power in dungeons while keeping them at a similar power level in raids. This is primarily accomplished through reducing the effectiveness of their Mastery and Regrowth, while bringing up the effectiveness of Wild Growth and some raid-oriented talents. We’re also doing some targeted buffs for some weaker, unpopular talents for Restoration.\nMastery: Harmony effectiveness reduced by 20%.\nIntensity increases Regrowth critical healing by 60% (was 75%).\nUnstoppable Growth reduces Wild Growth’s fall off by 30% per point (was 15%).\nImproved Wild Growth increases the number of Wild Growth targets by 2 (was 1).\nRegenesis increases healing done by Rejuvenation or Tranquility by up to 30% per point (was 15%).\nEmbrace of the Dream healing increased by 85%.\nMaster Shapeshifter generates 20% more mana from Wrath, Starfire, and Starsurge.\nNurturing Dormancy increases Rejuvenations duration by up to 6 seconds (was 4 seconds).\n\nEvoker\n\r\nHero Talents\n\r\nFlameshaper\n\r\nDevastation\n\r\nConsume Flame now consumed 4
