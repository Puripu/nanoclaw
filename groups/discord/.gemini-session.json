While the Gemini app on Android offers a versatile interface for accessing Google's AI models, my current toolset within this environment provides some distinct advantages for specific tasks:\n\n*   **Persistent Workspace:** I have a persistent workspace (`/workspace/group/`) where I can store and manage files. This allows me to maintain notes, research, and context across multiple interactions, something that a standard Gemini app session might not offer. I can update my memory (`CLAUDE.md`) and refer back to it.\n*   **Tool Integration:** I have access to specific tools like `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_command`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, and a basic browser with functions like `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_input`, and `browser_screenshot`. These tools allow me to perform actions that would be more complex or impossible within the Gemini app alone, such as running shell commands, creating and modifying files, and interacting with web pages programmatically.\n*   **Automation and Scripting:** The ability to run shell commands and use these tools in combination enables me to automate tasks and create simple scripts. For example, I can schedule a task to fetch news every morning and send you a summary. The Gemini app might not offer this level of automated functionality.\n*   **Specific API Access:** I have direct access to APIs like the Brave Search API, allowing for more controlled and specific information retrieval than general web searches within the Gemini app.\n\nIn summary, while the Gemini app provides a user-friendly interface and broad AI capabilities, my environment offers a more specialized and programmable toolkit, making me better suited for tasks that require persistent storage, tool integration, automation, and specific API access.\n"

This is a multi-stage research task, and I'll break it down into manageable steps:\n\n**Phase 1: Overseerr API Research & Connection**\n\n1.  **Research Overseerr API:** I need to thoroughly investigate the Overseerr API documentation to understand how to interact with it programmatically. I'll focus on endpoints related to:\n    *   Authentication\n    *   Searching for movies and TV shows\n    *   Submitting requests\n    *   Retrieving request status\n\n2.  **Authentication Method:** Determine the authentication method required by the Overseerr API (e.g., API keys, OAuth).\n\n3.  **API Interaction:** Explore how to make API requests using Python (since that's the environment I'm in) and the available tools. I'll look into using the `run_command` tool to execute `curl` commands or potentially using a Python library for making HTTP requests (if that can be made available).\n\n4.  **Proof of Concept:** Develop a basic proof-of-concept script that can:\n    *   Authenticate with your Overseerr instance.\n    *   Search for a specific movie or TV show.\n    *   Submit a request for that media.\n    *   Report back the status of the request.\n\n**Phase 2: Integration and Automation**\n\n1.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Explore how to use NLP techniques to understand your requests for movies and TV shows. This might involve identifying the title, release year, and any other relevant information.\n\n2.  **Overseerr Status Tracking:** Implement a mechanism to track the status of your requests in Overseerr. This would involve periodically querying the API to check if a request has been approved, fulfilled, etc.\n\n3.  **Scheduling:** Utilize the available tools to schedule tasks that automatically check for upcoming shows and movies you might be interested in, and then submit requests to Overseerr.\n\n**Phase 3: Learning Preferences and Media Library Management (Long-Term Goal)**\n\n1.  **Preference Learning:** Develop a system to learn your preferences based on your viewing history, ratings, and explicit feedback. This could involve using machine learning techniques to build a preference model.\n\n2.  **Media Library Integration:** Integrate with your media library (e.g., Plex, Emby) to track what media you already have and avoid requesting duplicates.\n\n3.  **Automated Recommendations:** Provide automated recommendations for new media based on your learned preferences.\n\nI'll start with Phase 1, focusing on researching the Overseerr API and developing a proof-of-concept script. I will start by searching for the Overseerr API documentation.\n"

This document describes all the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.\n\nNow, let's analyze the authentication methods. The documentation states:\n\n\"Two primary authentication methods are supported:\n\n*   **Cookie Authentication**: A valid sign-in to the `/auth/plex` or `/auth/local` will generate a valid authentication cookie.\n*   **API Key Authentication**: Sign-in is also possible by passing an `X-Api-Key` header along with a valid API Key generated by Overseerr.\"\n\nSince you've provided the `OVERSEER_API` environment variable, we'll focus on the API Key authentication method. This means I need to include an `X-Api-Key` header in my requests.\n\nNext, I need to choose an endpoint to test with. A simple one to start with would be `/status`, which \"Returns the current Overseerr status in a JSON object\" and requires no authentication. However, to properly test authentication, let's try `/settings/main`, which \"Retrieves all main settings in a JSON object.\"\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  Construct a `curl` command to make a GET request to `/settings/main`.\n2.  Include the `X-Api-Key` header with the value from the `OVERSEER_API` environment variable.\n3.  Include the `OVERSEER_URL` in the curl command.\n4.  Execute the `curl` command using the `run_command` tool.\n5.  Parse the output to check if the request was successful.\n"
