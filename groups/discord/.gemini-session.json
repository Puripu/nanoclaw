These messages often indicate the cause of the problem (e.g., network issues, invalid URL, website blocking the request).\n2.  **Website Accessibility:** I'll try to determine if the target websites are reachable. I can use `web_search` to check if the website is down.\n3.  **Complex Website Structure:** Some websites are very complex and difficult for the browser to parse correctly. If this is the case, I'll try simplifying the search query or using a different website.\n4.  **Tool Limitations:** It's possible there are limitations in how the `use_browser` tool handles certain types of websites or content. I'll keep this in mind and try alternative approaches if necessary.\n5.  **Timeout Issues:** The browser might be timing out while trying to load the page. I'll monitor the execution time and see if this is a factor.\n\nAfter checking these points, I'll provide you with a detailed explanation of why the browser might not be working as expected.\n\nIn the meantime, I will wait for the \"world news\" search to complete and let you know the results.\n"

It's unlikely that the basic search functionality is broken.\n\n4.  **Tool Limitations:** It's possible that the `use_browser` tool has limitations in how it interacts with Brave Search. Perhaps the way the search query is being passed is not compatible, or the tool struggles with Brave's specific website structure. The `use_browser` tool might also struggle with Javascript heavy sites.\n\n5.  **Timeout Issues:** The browser might be timing out while trying to load the page or execute the search. The command seems to hang indefinitely, which suggests a possible timeout.\n\n**Possible Solutions and Further Investigation:**\n\n*   **Simplify the Search Query:** Try a simpler search query to rule out issues with complex queries.\n*   **Try a Different Website:** Use `use_browser` with a different search engine like Google or DuckDuckGo to see if the problem is specific to Brave Search.\n*   **Check Network Connectivity:** Verify that the system has a stable internet connection.\n*   **Contact Support:** If the problem persists, it might be necessary to contact the tool developers for further assistance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most likely cause of the failure is a limitation of the `use_browser` tool in interacting with Brave Search or a timeout issue. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact root cause.\n"
