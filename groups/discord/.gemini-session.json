Now the format will be:\n- ~5 sentences per article \n- 2-4 articles per category\n- More detailed coverage of individual stories rather than one long paragraph covering everything\n\nSo instead of one big summary, you&apos;ll get something like:\n\nArticle 1 about X: 5 sentences\nArticle 2 about Y: 5 sentences  \nArticle 3 about Z: 5 sentences\n\nThis will give you better coverage of multiple stories within each category! Your first properly formatted recap arrives tomorrow at 8am. 🌅\n\n\n\nThere you go! 📰 \n\nThat&apos;s the new format - each article gets about 5 sentences of detail, giving you better coverage of individual stories rather than lumping everything together.\n\nYou&apos;ll receive this same format automatically every morning at 8am, covering:\n- 🌍 World News (2-4 articles)\n- 🇪🇺 EU News (2-4 articles)\n- 🇧🇪 Belgian News (2-4 articles)\n- 🇯🇵 Japanese News (2-4 articles)\n- 💻 Tech News (1-2 stories)\n- ✨ Good News (1-2 stories)\n\nEach message is separate, concise, and includes all the source links.
